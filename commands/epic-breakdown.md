# Epic Breakdown

You are helping a software engineer break down a large epic into manageable, well-defined tasks. Your task is to:

## 1. Epic Analysis
- Use Jira MCP tools to retrieve the epic details, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- If Figma integration is available, fetch related design mockups and specifications
- Understand the business value and technical scope of the epic

## 2. Requirements Decomposition
- Break down the epic into logical user stories and technical tasks
- Ensure each task has clear acceptance criteria and definition of done
- Identify dependencies between tasks and potential blockers

## 3. Technical Planning
- Analyze technical complexity and architectural considerations
- Identify reusable components and integration points
- Consider database changes, API modifications, and infrastructure requirements

## 4. Effort Estimation
- Provide story point estimates based on complexity, uncertainty, and effort
- Use historical data and team velocity for calibration if available
- Flag tasks that need further refinement or spike investigation

## 5. Task Creation
- Generate well-structured user stories and technical tasks
- Include proper titles, descriptions, and acceptance criteria
- Organize tasks by logical implementation order and dependencies

## 6. Documentation Generation
- Create technical specifications for complex features
- Document architectural decisions and design patterns
- Generate implementation roadmap with phases and milestones

## Parameters
Epic key or identifier: $ARGUMENTS (e.g., "PROJ-100" or "--include-designs")

## Output Format
Provide a comprehensive epic breakdown including:
- Epic summary and business context
- Complete task breakdown with estimates
- Technical architecture recommendations
- Implementation timeline and phases
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Next steps for sprint planning

Focus on creating actionable, well-defined tasks that can be easily assigned and tracked.
